# Process for submitting work to this project

* On Trello, pairs should assign themselves to a card in 'To do' and move it across to 'In progress'
* Make sure your local master is up to date, then create an appropriately named branch
* When the feature is complete and the tests are passing, make a PR and move the ticket to `In Review`
* Review each other's PRs and then ping me for an approval
* Once code is merged into master, ensure it is deployed correctly to heroku
* Move the ticket into 'Done' only once it is successfully in production

## Tips

- keep PRs small and easy to understand
- Write a good description of the purpose of the new code
- keep updating your local master and feature branch if remote master is updated
- Discuss each other's code on the PR to ask for clarification and congratulate each other!
- Write clear and purposeful commit messages (Squash all the unnecessary things)s
